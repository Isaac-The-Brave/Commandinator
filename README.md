# Version 0.0.1

# Commandinator
A GPT-J Neural Network Application That Turns Natural Language Statements to Ubuntu (or linux) Commands! 

# Install the necessary libraries (I use openssl for libcurl, but if you have an alternative you can use, please go ahead.)

sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libjsoncpp-dev

# This program is simple to use. Launch Exec.bin and input the command you want GPT-J to generate for you
Through using GPT-J's Transformer model, we can turn natural language, a.k.a normal words into complex linux CLI commands.

## Give it a try! 

This is my first attempt at a C++ program. I needed to use the 'curl' library and 'jsoncpp' to get this program going. 

## Special Thanks to vicgalle.net for allowing people to use his GPT-J API.
