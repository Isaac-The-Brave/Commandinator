# Commandinator
A GPT-J Neural Network Application That Turns Natural Language Statements to Ubuntu (or linux) Commands! 

# This program is simple to use. Launch Exec.bin and input the command you want GPT-J to generate for you
Through using GPT-J's Transformer model, we can turn natural language, a.k.a normal words into complex linux CLI commands.
