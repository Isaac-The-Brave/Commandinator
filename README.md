# Version 0.0.1
## Made For Ubuntu

# Commandinator
A GPT-J Neural Network Application That Turns Natural Language Statements to Ubuntu (or linux) Commands! 

# Install the necessary libraries (I use openssl for libcurl, but if you have an alternative you can use, please go ahead.)

sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libjsoncpp-dev

# This program is simple to use. Launch Exec.bin and input the command you want GPT-J to generate for you
Through using GPT-J's Transformer model, we can turn natural language, a.k.a normal words into complex linux CLI commands.

## Give it a try! 
You can either compile it yourself, or just run ./Exec.bin and it will ask for your input after you do. Simple as that
## Special Thanks to vicgalle.net for allowing people to use his GPT-J API.
